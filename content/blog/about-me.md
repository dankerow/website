## Welcome to my portfolio!

You probably know this already or not, but my name is Dan. I am a software developer based in Canada. Still studying Computer Science, looking forward to working in cyber-security.
I am passionate about expressing my creativity through programming and graphic design. I first developed an interest in these areas in late 2015 and have been continuously learning and honing my skills ever since.

I am naturally inquisitive and enjoy learning new things, which makes me a great team player. Additionally, I am fluent in French, English, and Italian, and am currently learning Spanish, which I already understand well.
Basketball is my favorite sport, and I enjoy playing it in my free time. I also enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and listening to music.

In terms of my skills, I am proficient in front-end languages such as HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript (ES6+). I also have experience with frameworks and libraries such as Node.js, Express, Vue, Nuxt.js, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Bulma.

On the backend, I am proficient in Node.js and TypeScript. I am also familiar with tools such as Git/GitHub, MongoDB, and Redis.

In addition to programming and graphic design, I also have experience in photography and photo editing.

Thank you for visiting my website and I look forward to the opportunity to share my skills and experience with you.
