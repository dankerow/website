## Welcome to my portfolio website!

My name is Dan, and I am a software developer from Canada. I am passionate about expressing my creativity through the mediums of web development and graphic design. I first developed an interest in these areas in late 2015 and have been continuously learning and honing my skills ever since.

I am naturally inquisitive and enjoy learning new things, which makes me a great team player. Additionally, I am fluent in French, English, and Italian, and am currently learning Spanish, which I already understand well.

In terms of my skills, I am proficient in front-end languages such as HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript (ES6+). I also have experience with frameworks and libraries such as Node.js, Express, Vue, Nuxt.js, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Bulma. My toolset includes Git/GitHub.

On the backend, I am proficient in Node.js and TypeScript. I am also familiar with tools such as Git/GitHub, MongoDB, and Redis.

In addition to web development, I am also proficient in graphic design software such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Figma. I also have experience in photography and can use software such as Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Photoshop.

I have had the opportunity to gain real-world experience as a web developer through an internship that I completed from June 2020 to March 2021. During this time, I individually built a web application to manage the inventory of the company using Express.js, Bootstrap, and MongoDB. This improved efficiency for up to 5 IT department staff and transferred the inventory management from MS Access to a web application that was available on mobile and computer devices.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio website and I look forward to the opportunity to share my skills and experience with you.
